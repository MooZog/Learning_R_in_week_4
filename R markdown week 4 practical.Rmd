## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## Beaver temperature
```{r beaver1}
summary(beaver1)
list(beaver1)
```
## A numbered list for the beavers
# I have made up a name for 4 of the beavers
 1. Alice - temp 36.33
 2. Rupert - temp 36.34
 3. Gerald - temp 36.35
 4. Lucille - temp 36.42
 
## Who survived the Titanic
```{r Titanic}
summary(Titanic)
```
### A random unordered list
## White Star Line had 3 Olympic-class ocean liners
 * Olympic
 * Britannic
 * Titanic
 
## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
